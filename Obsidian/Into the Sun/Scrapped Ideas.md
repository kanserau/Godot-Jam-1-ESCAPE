### FUEL (stretch goal)
**FUEL** provides power to the ship via the **GENERATOR**.
- *Fuel is consumed constantly* based on power % used.
- If fuel runs out, all systems in the ship stop working (life support, thrusters, shields, weapons, all terminals and gauges)
- The generator must be refuelled MANUALLY, by picking up a **FUEL CAN** and pouring it into the fuel receptacle. This can be done at any time even while the engine is running, however it takes time.
- Strategy note: downtime can be used to refuel the generator to avoid running into issues later.
