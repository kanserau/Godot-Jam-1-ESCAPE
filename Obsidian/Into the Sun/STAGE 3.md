### Map of the Ship
- [ ] It's a map of the ship. Just a basic poster.
## Gauge Rack
The gauge rack is horizontal, and below the power shunting and status displays.
Includes the following readings:
- [ ] **Altitude Indicator**:
	- Displays the ship's current distance from the sun.
	- Appearance: As per flight equivalent (altitude indicator)
	- Lore: Displays distance from nearest planetary object by measuring gravitational pull and comparing to a planetary database.
	- Has an INITIAL VALUE, affected by VERTICAL SPEED
- [ ] **Vertical Speed Indicator**:
	- Displays how quickly the ship is moving away from the Sun.
	- Appearance: As per flight equivalent (vertical speed indicator)
	- Lore: Works by measuring rate of change in gravitational pull. Useful for planetary takeoffs and landings.
	- Affected by THRUST LEVEL and ALTITUDE
- [ ] **Thrust Gauge**:
	- Displays current thrust level. 
	- Appearance: Like an RPM gauge. Green area indicates "efficient" usage. Red (above green) indicates "dangerous usage"
	- Affected by POWER SHUNTING (engine/thrust)
- [ ] **Oxygen Gauge**:
	- Displays current oxygen levels.
	- Appearance: Green area indicates "safe" levels. Red indicates unsafe levels, and is both above (toxic) and below (insufficient) the green.
	- Lore: complex atmospheric sensors
	- Affected by POWER SHUNTING (atmosphere generator) and EMERGENCIES (hull breach, fire)
- [ ] Ship Integrity Gauge
