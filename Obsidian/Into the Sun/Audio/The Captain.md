# The Captain
Here is a list of all voice lines required. 
## Character
**Chill aussie**: Never reacts to a situation with more than mild surprise. Possibly a little too calm. Describes things in a way that would make anyone panic, but remains calm and matter-o-fact.
## Events
Each of these events calls for its own line. Major events can be longer.
